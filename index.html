		<p>With katam coop speedruns becoming more accessible thanks to katam soon releasing on NSO. I'm expecting there to be a greater interest in coop speedruns of this game. Below you will find links to the map guides for the any% 2P and 3P routes, along with videos and notes for the routes in point form.</p>
		<p>Credit for the interactable Katam Map goes to <a href="https://isofrieze.com/">IsoFrieze.</a> My version is simply a fork of that.</p>
